Files: 
	shell.c : Runs the shell using user input as per described in the instructions
	shell.h : header file for shell.c. Stores function definitions
	makefile: compiles shell.c and shell.h into shell.o
How to compile and run: Open your linux terminal, cd into the folder where the files are stored, type in "make" and hit enter. Then type ./shell and hit enter to execute the shell

Challenges: the main challenge I faced was trying to run my program in windows which my c code was not meant to do. To combat this I ran am Ubuntu virtual machine to run my code

Help received: I asked chatgpt for some help with forks and how exactly then work, basically conceptional questions. Other than that, my code is from the lecture pdf plus my own code
